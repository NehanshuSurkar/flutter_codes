# Schedulo App

A new Flutter project.
This is my first project built with Flutter! 
As a beginner in app development, I decided to dive into the world of Flutter to create this simple yet functional to-do app. 
From crafting the UI to implementing the logic, every step of this project has been a fantastic learning experience for me. 
The app boasts a clean and user-friendly interface designed to enhance productivity and simplicity.

Features:
1)Add, Delete, Edit tasks.
2)Mark your tasks as completed.
3)Keep track of your completed and incompleted tasks. 
4)The todo list stays intact even after closing the app.
5)Option for Calculator.
