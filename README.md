# Schedulo App

A new Flutter project.
This is my first ever project built with Flutter! 
As a beginner in app development, I decided to dive into the world of Flutter to create this simple yet functional todo app. 
From crafting the UI to implementing the logic, every step of this project has been a fantastic learning experience for me. 
The app boasts a clean and user-friendly interface designed to enhance productivity and simplicity.

Features:
1)Add, Delete, Edit tasks.
2)Mark your tasks as completed.
3)Keep track of your completed and incompleted tasks. 
4)The todo list stays intact even after closing the app.
5)Option for Calculator.
